# Rustic FPS
There's a pun in there somewhere and I'm not the one who's going to find it.

This is a simple Ã  la Wolfenstein 3D game/demo/learning project with the main 
goal of trying out rust.

### Prerequisites
SDL2 is required for this to work. It should be as simple as `cargo build`.

## Licence 
This project is licenced under MIT Licence - see the [LICENCE](LICENCE) file for details.
